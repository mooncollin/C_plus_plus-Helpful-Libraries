# Collin's Useful C++ Libraries

All the files are header only files that attempt to be an extension onto the current C++ standard library.

With new releases of C++, some of these libraries will become obsolete.

Think of these files as like mods to a video game. Vanilla is sometimes just so old fashioned and boring. Mods make it exciting (and sometimes just plain easier).
